> **Evidence Note:** 
> Due to remote environment constraints, the visual UI PNG screenshots (`UI_P193_tab_01.png`, etc.) could not be saved using the subagent recording. However, all source code events were rigorously grep-scanned (`docs/UI_grep_inventory.log`), the machine mappings generated (`docs/UI_MAP.json`), and the exact Open API endpoints verified via raw Swagger curl (`docs/swagger_evidence.json`). No guesses were made, and no code was modified.
